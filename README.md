# Discord Messages

A small Discord package message parser, because I noticed there wasn't really much out there

The main index file is small, so you can verify that it isn't malicious

## Usages

1. Request a copy of your Discord package, and extract the `package` folder into the root of this project.
2. Then, run `index.js` via Node.
3. Then, open the index file from inside `parsed` to view the results
